# C Basic Client-Server File Sender

This mini-project is meant to begin learning C with, work on some socket programming, and sets the foundation for a client-server structure featuring the Python ACFT Calculator. 
- Server is hosted on Ubuntu Server
- Client is hosted on Windows 11
- Sends a single file from the client to the server, messages to and from, with commented out code for simpler functions.
- Internal network only - I'm not opening up my public IP or any ports to be used willy-nilly, now!
